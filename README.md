# hello-world
This is a test repository for learning github. It's my first time using it so I expect there may be some common errors, but I'm learning! Fun so far. :)

A bit about me:

Always enjoyed computer programming, and very excited to be learning how to use it in a professional setting. 

Outside of work, I love playing basketball (pickup and leagues), collecting and playing vinyl (I have a monthly gig at a dive bar in Berkeley), and recently I've started playing Magic: The Gathering.
